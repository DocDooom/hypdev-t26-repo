# Overview: A task manager with login, allowing users to view, add tasks. Administrators have extra privileges
# such as adding/registering new users and viewing stats associated with the user base
# IMPORTANT! Please note I'll be omitting docstring documentation for functions as the code is already very long
# comments about code functionality will still be included as usual

# ===== importing libraries ===========
'''This is the section where you will import libraries'''
# We'll need the current date when assigning tasks
from dataclasses import dataclass
# We need some functions from typing Typevar to create our placeholder types and Union
# to indicate we can return multiple types
from typing import TypeVar, Union
# We need this to compare dates, convert to date etc
from datetime import date, datetime
# We'll need to wrap the text when printing out tasks to the user
import textwrap
# We're importing os primarily to check for file existence

# Here we're creating a type variable T bound to "User" that we'll use as a place-holder to
# indicate the User as a type

# -------- Classes --------
# Note: The user class right now is not completely necessary especially if we are using a txt file and are not
# using something like Pickle to serialize the data. However, I plan to expand this later.
# So for now we'll use the class in some minimal way
# The @dataclass decorator implements __init__ among other methods automatically for us
